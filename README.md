A machine learning project for detecting spam emails and messages using a TF-IDF vectorizer and a classification model.

> **⚠️ Work in Progress:** This repository is currently under development. API integration coming soon!



## 🎯 Overview

Email spam detection is a critical component of modern email systems. This project implements a machine learning model using TF-IDF vectorization and classification algorithms to automatically identify and filter spam emails and messages.

## ✨ Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Advanced cleaning and normalization of text data
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Efficient text representation for machine learning
- **Spam Classification**: Machine learning model for accurate spam detection
- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for preprocessing, model training, and utilities
- **Modular Design**: Easily extensible architecture for future improvements
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## 📝 API Integration (Coming Soon)

### Planned Endpoints

```python
POST /api/v1/predict
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email_text": "Your email content here",
  "return_confidence": true
}

Response:
{
  "prediction": "spam",
  "confidence": 0.97,
  "timestamp": "2025-12-08T10:30:00Z"
}
```
